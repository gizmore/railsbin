# railsbin

A mini pastebin RubyOnRails implementation which contains security holes for hacking challenge demo purposes.

# Purpose

This pastebin implementation is basic and under development.

It has known security problems, and should not be forked and _not_ used in production environments!

Sadly i canÂ´t tell you about the exact security problems, without spoiling the game. YLIT ;)
